# Employee-attrition-
 In this Model Keras API is used with Tensorflow in backend:
### In this Deep Learning Model there are/is:
			1) 5 Keras Dense Layer
			2) 1 Keras Dropout Layer with a dropout of 0.25
			3) 2 types of activation function used: (a) Relu
								(b) Linear
			4) Optimizer: Adam

### Data is preprocessed using :
			(a) Pandas(handling missing values)
			(b) Sklearn (Label Encoding of some features and Onehotencoding of the data set).

### Live Loss Plot is visualised using:
				(a) livelossplot library

Model Weights During Training is saved as a 'h5' file in the folder "tmp_weights".
Model architecture is saved in model_h5 folder as a 'h5' file.
Model in json file is saved as 'model.json'
Main Jupyter notebook is saved as 'Employee Attrition.ipynb'
